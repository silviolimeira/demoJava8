Java 8 - Stream API | forEach & filter method example

- Functional Programming
- Code Reduce
- Bulk Operation

Filter - for conditional check
forEach - for iteration

- Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
      A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods
  which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.

- A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the
     Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
     
- Streams don't change the original data structure, they only
      provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
